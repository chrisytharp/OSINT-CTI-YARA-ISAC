Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)

  	Are used to share and exchange various Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to obtain threat intelligence. IOCs can include MD5s,
  	IPs, YARA rules, and more. There are many ISACs that can be used to gather threat intelligence including AlienVault OTX, Threat Connect, and MISP.

TTP is an acronym for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, but what does each of these terms mean?
		The Tactic is the adversary's goal or objective.
		The Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
		The Procedure is how the technique is executed.

IOCs is an acronym for Indicators of Compromise, the indicators for malware and adversary groups. Indicators can include file hashes, IPs, names, etc.
 
Threat Intelligence, aka TI aka Cyber Threat Intelligence(CTI) is used to provide information about the threat landscape specifically adversaries and 
their TTPs. Typically CTI revolves around APT groups and/or other threats, these can be well-known groups or up and coming new threats!

	Data must be analyzed to be considered threat intelligence. 
	Once analyzed and actionable, then it becomes threat intelligence. 
	The data needs context around to become intel.

CTI is a precautionary measure that companies use so that other corporations do not get hit with the same attacks. But Adversaries change their TTPs all the time so 
the TI landscape is constantly changing.

Vendors and corporations will sometimes share their collected CTI in what are called ISACs or Information Sharing and Analysis Centers. ISACs collect various indicators of 
an adversary that other corporations can use as a precaution against adversaries.

	Strategic
	Assist senior management make informed decisions specifically about the security budget and strategies.

	Tactical
	Interacts with the TTPs and attack models to identify adversary attack patterns.

	Operational
	Interact with IOCs and how the adversaries operationalize 
	
We will be focusing on ISACs as they pertain to cybersecurity and cyber threat intelligence; however, ISACs can be utilized for more than just cybersecurity.

Below is a list of ISACs that can help a blue team:
	US-CERT
	AlienVault OTX
	ThreatConnect
	MISP
