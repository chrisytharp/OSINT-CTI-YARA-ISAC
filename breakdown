!! YARA: hexadecimal strings, text strings and regular expressions!!

--- syntax that resembles the C languag

---rule dummy
   {
       condition:
          false
   }

---YARA starts with the keyword rule followed by a rule identifier. Identifiers must follow the same lexical conventions of the C programming language, they can contain any alphanumeric character and the underscore character, but the first character can not be a digit. Rule identifiers are CASE SENSITIVE and cannot exceed 128 characters.

---Rules are generally composed of two sections: STRING DEFINITAION & CONDITION

--he strings definition section can be omitted if the rule doesn’t rely on any string, but the condition section is always required

--- Each string has an identifier consisting of a $ character followed by a sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores, 

--Text strings are enclosed in double quotes just like in the C language. Hex strings are enclosed by curly brackets, and they are composed by a sequence of hexadecimal numbers that can appear contiguously or separated by spaces. Decimal numbers are not allowed in hex strings.

---three types of STRINGS in YARA: hexadecimal strings, text strings and regular expressions.

---Text strings in YARA are case-sensitive by default, however you can turn your string into case-insensitive 

--- rule CaseInsensitiveTextExample
   {
       strings:
           $text_string = "foobar" nocase

       condition:
           $text_string
   }

metadata identifiers are always followed by an equals sign and the value assigned to them. The assigned values can be strings, integers, or one of the boolean values

Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC™)  
	This document provides a brief introduction to Version 5.0 of the Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC™) Language, an overview of the MAEC data models, a 	discussion of top-level objects, and an example MAEC Package.



STIX
Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX™) is a structured language for describing cyber threat information so it can be shared, stored, and analyzed in a consistent manner. STIX uses the CybOX Language to describe cyber observables. The CybOX schema is natively imported and used within STIX to characterize system and network events and behaviors observed within the operational cyber domain or observable patterns for use within cyber indicators.

TAXII
Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII™) is the main transport mechanism for cyber threat information represented in STIX. Through the use of TAXII services, organizations can share cyber threat information in a secure and automated manner. TAXII uses STIX to represent cyber threat information in a standardized and structured manner, and STIX uses CybOX to represent cyber observables.



MAEC	(document malware behavior)
Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC™) is a standardized language for encoding and communicating high-fidelity information about malware based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and attack patterns. MAEC uses the CybOX Language to describe cyber observables. The CybOX schema is imported and used within MAEC to characterize malware-related system and network events and behaviors observed within the operational cyber domain.

CAPEC	(identify attack patterns)
Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC™) is a publicly available, community-developed list of common attack patterns along with a comprehensive schema and classification taxonomy. The CybOX schema is imported and used within CAPEC to characterize system and network events and behaviors observed within the operational cyber domain.
